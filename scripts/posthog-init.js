/**
 * PostHog init — runs after posthog-bundle.js has defined window.posthog.
 * No CDN loading, no <script> tag injection — fully self-contained so it works
 * on pages with Trusted Types policies (e.g. LinkedIn).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: addInitScript runs in ALL frames (including about:blank iframes).
 * We must guard against iframe execution to avoid:
 * - SecurityErrors on opaque-origin frames (can't access cookies)
 * - Duplicate PostHog instances that corrupt session recording data
 * - Broken sessions showing "all inactivity" in the PostHog dashboard
