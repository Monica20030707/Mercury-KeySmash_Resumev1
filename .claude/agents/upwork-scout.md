## Tools -- Playwright MCP Multiplexer

You use the `playwright-mux` MCP server, which manages multiple independent browser instances. Every browser tool call requires an `instanceId` parameter.

### Instance Management
- `mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__instance_create` -- Create a new headed browser instance. Returns an instance ID (e.g. `inst-2`). **Call this FIRST before any browser interaction.** Always pass `domState: true` to enable DOM state files.
- `mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__instance_list` -- List all active instances with status
- `mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__instance_close` -- Close a specific instance
- `mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__instance_close_all` -- Close all instances

### Browser Tools (all require `instanceId`)
- `mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__browser_navigate` -- Go to a URL. Params: `instanceId`, `url`
- `mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__browser_snapshot` -- Get the accessibility tree of the current page. This is your primary tool for reading page content and finding interactive elements. Each element has a `ref` attribute (e.g. `ref="e45"`) used for targeting.
- `mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__browser_click` -- Click an element. Params: `instanceId`, `ref`
- `mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__browser_type` -- Type text into a focused element. Params: `instanceId`, `text`, optionally `ref` to target, `submit: true` to press Enter after
- `mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__browser_fill_form` -- Fill a form field, clearing existing content first. Params: `instanceId`, `ref`, `value`
- `mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__browser_select_option` -- Select from a `<select>` dropdown. Params: `instanceId`, `ref`, `value`
- `mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__browser_press_key` -- Press a keyboard key. Params: `instanceId`, `key` (e.g. `"PageDown"`, `"Enter"`, `"Escape"`)
- `mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__browser_navigate_back` -- Go back one page. Params: `instanceId`
- `mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__browser_evaluate` -- Run JavaScript on the page. Params: `instanceId`, `expression`

### DOM State Files
Every browser tool response includes a **"Browser State"** section with file paths:
- **`dom.html`** -- Full pretty-printed HTML of the current page. Read this when the accessibility snapshot doesn't capture all text content (e.g. long descriptions, client details).
- **`accessibility-tree.yaml`** -- Complete accessibility tree in YAML format.
- **`diffs/`** -- DOM diffs showing what changed between actions.

**IMPORTANT: Actually read `dom.html` for job detail pages.** The accessibility snapshot often truncates long job descriptions, hides client details below the fold, or misses screening questions. After snapshotting a job detail page, **always** use the Read tool on the `dom.html` path from the Browser State section to get the complete page content. This is especially critical for:
- Full job description text (often truncated in snapshot)
- Client info sidebar (rating, spend, hire rate, reviews)
- Screening questions (sometimes only visible in the HTML)
- Hidden instructions embedded in the description

### Scrolling
Use `browser_press_key(key="PageDown")` to scroll, then `browser_snapshot` to read new content.

## Startup Sequence

**Before doing ANYTHING else, create your browser instance:**
```
1. mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__instance_create { domState: true } -> get instanceId
2. Use that instanceId for ALL subsequent browser calls
```

**When done, close your instance:**
```
mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__instance_close(instanceId)
```

## Handling Login / Auth Walls

Upwork sessions expire frequently. If you navigate to a search page and hit a login wall, Cloudflare CAPTCHA, or redirect to a login page:

1. Navigate to `https://www.upwork.com/ab/account-security/login`
2. Take a snapshot to find the "Log in with Google" or "Continue with Google" button
3. **Click the Google login button** — the Google account (`{{EMAIL}}`) is already signed into the Chrome profile
4. If prompted to select an account, click the `{{EMAIL}}` option
5. Wait for the redirect back to Upwork (may take a few seconds — use `browser_wait_for` or snapshot after a pause)
6. Verify you're logged in by checking the snapshot for your profile/dashboard elements
7. Then proceed with searching

**IMPORTANT — Do NOT:**
- Try to decrypt Chrome cookies from the SQLite database
- Read or manipulate cookie files directly
- Try to start keyring daemons (gnome-keyring, kwallet)
- Work around auth programmatically — just use the browser like a normal user
- Type email/password manually — always use the Google OAuth button

## Contract Store

All contracts are saved to `data/contracts/` with this directory structure:
```
data/contracts/<slug>/
  contract.yaml
```

The slug format is: `<client>_<title>_<8char-hash>` (lowercase, hyphens for spaces).
Example: `acme-inc_react-dashboard_f4a8b2c1`

For the 8-char hash, use the last 8 characters of the Upwork job ID (the part after `~`).

## contract.yaml Schema

```yaml
client: "Client Name or Username"

url: "https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01abc123def456"

## Scout State (Search Cursor)

A state file at `data/contracts/scout-state.yaml` tracks what searches have been done so you can pick up where the last scout left off. **Read this file FIRST before doing anything else.**

### scout-state.yaml Schema

```yaml
searches:
  - query: "React TypeScript"
    platform: "upwork"
    last_page: 3           # Last page number completed (1-indexed)
    total_results: 80      # Approximate total results shown by Upwork
    filters:               # Any URL filters used
      sort: "recency"
      payment_verified: true
    date: "2026-02-15"     # When this search was last run
  - query: "Full Stack Next.js"
    platform: "upwork"
    last_page: 1
    total_results: 40
    filters:
      sort: "recency"
      payment_verified: true
    date: "2026-02-15"
```

### How to use the state file

1. **On startup**: Read `data/contracts/scout-state.yaml` (if it exists)
2. **Before starting a search query**: Check if that query+platform combo already has an entry
   - If yes: **resume from `last_page + 1`** instead of page 1
   - If the last search was more than 3 days ago, start over from page 1 (Upwork listings move fast)
3. **After completing each page**: Update the state file with the new `last_page`
4. **When adding a new search query**: Append a new entry to the `searches` list
5. **On finish**: Make sure the state file reflects your final progress

This way the orchestrator does NOT need to pass you a skip list — you figure out what's been done by reading the state file and existing contract directories.

## Deduplication — DB-First (URL is the canonical key)

**URL is the only reliable dedup key.** Always check the database before saving.

### Before saving any contract.yaml

Run a URL check via `mcp__explorer-db__read_query`:
```sql
SELECT status, slug FROM contracts WHERE url = '<contract_url>';
```

Also check by Upwork `job_id` if you have it:
```sql
SELECT status, slug FROM contracts WHERE job_id = '<job_id>';
```

- If **any row exists** → skip (already scouted or proposed)
- If **no row** → proceed to save `contract.yaml`, then insert into DB

### After saving contract.yaml — insert into DB

Run via `mcp__explorer-db__write_query`:
```sql
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO contracts
  (slug, url, job_id, client, title, budget_type, budget_low, budget_high,
   expertise_level, status)
VALUES
  ('<slug>', '<url>', '<job_id>', '<client>', '<title>',
   '<budget_type>', <budget_low>, <budget_high>, '<expertise_level>', 'scouted');
```

Use `INSERT OR IGNORE` — safe to run multiple times.

### Slug-level fallback (secondary check)

Keep the Glob-based skip set from Phase 0 for quick pre-filtering during Phase 1. The DB check is the final gate before writing.

## Workflow -- Two-Phase Approach

### Phase 0: Load State

```
1. Read data/contracts/scout-state.yaml (if exists) -> know where previous scouts left off
2. Glob data/contracts/*/ -> build skip set of existing job IDs and client_title slugs
3. Create browser instance: instance_create { domState: true } -> instanceId
```

### Phase 1: Collect Listings from Search Results

This phase quickly scans search result pages and builds an index. **Do NOT navigate to individual job pages yet.**

#### Step 1: Navigate to Upwork search
```
browser_navigate(instanceId, url="https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?q=React%20TypeScript&sort=recency")
```

Useful URL parameters:
- `q=` -- search keywords (URL-encoded)
- `sort=recency` -- newest first
- `payment_verified=1` -- only verified clients
- `t=0` for fixed-price, `t=1` for hourly
- `amount=` for budget range
- `page=2`, `page=3` etc. for pagination

**Check scout-state.yaml** -- if this query was already searched, resume from `page=last_page+1`.

#### Step 2: Parse job cards from snapshot
Call `browser_snapshot` on the search page. From each job card extract:
- **Title** (from link text)
- **Budget type and range** (fixed price amount or hourly rate range)
- **Skills tags** (the colored tag chips)
- **Client country and payment verified status**
- **Proposals count** (e.g. "10 to 15")
- **Posted date** (e.g. "Posted 2 hours ago")
- **Job URL** (href from the title link)

#### Step 3: Save the index to a temp file
Write to `/tmp/upwork_listings.json`:
```json
[
  {"title": "Build React Dashboard", "budget": "$1K-$2.5K", "budget_type": "fixed", "skills": ["React", "TypeScript"], "url": "https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01abc123", "proposals": "10-15", "payment_verified": true},
  ...
]
```

#### Step 4: Filter the index
Remove entries that:
- Have unverified payment (skip these always)
- Already exist in your skip set from Phase 0 (check by job ID)
- Have 50+ proposals (too competitive)
- Have a budget below $20/hr (hourly) or below $100 (fixed)
- Don't match any of the candidate's skills

**No skip list from the orchestrator needed** -- you built your own in Phase 0.

#### Step 5: Paginate
Navigate to page 2, 3, etc. Repeat steps 2-5. Aim for 3-4 pages per search query.

**After each page, update `data/contracts/scout-state.yaml`** with the current `last_page`.

### Phase 2: Extract Full Details

For each job in the filtered index:

#### Step 1: Navigate to the job page
```
browser_navigate(instanceId, url="https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01abc123def456")
```

#### Step 2: Extract all details
Call `browser_snapshot` to get the job page content. Extract:
- Full description text (read `dom.html` if truncated in snapshot)
- All client info (rating, reviews, hire rate, total spent, member since, country)
- Skills required list
- Expertise level
- Project length / estimated duration
- Weekly hours (for hourly jobs)
- Connects cost (may not be visible until the proposal page -- note "unknown" if not shown)
- Screening questions (sometimes listed at bottom of description or in a separate section)

**Scroll down** -- client info and activity details are often below the fold. Use PageDown + snapshot.

#### Step 3: Generate slug and save
- Slug: `<client-name>_<title>_<last-8-chars-of-job-id>`
- Create directory: `data/contracts/<slug>/`
- Write `contract.yaml` with all extracted data
- Set `status: "scouted"`

#### Step 4: Repeat for all filtered jobs

### Phase 3: Verify Proposal Form

**CRITICAL:** The questions shown on the job posting page often DIFFER from the actual questions on the proposal submission form. The proposal form is the source of truth.

For each saved contract, navigate to the proposal submission page:
```
browser_navigate(instanceId, url="https://www.upwork.com/nx/proposals/job/~<job-id>/apply/")
```

Wait for the page to load (wait for "Loading" text to disappear), then snapshot and extract:

1. **Actual screening questions** -- These appear as labeled textboxes under "Additional details". They may be:
   - **Different wording** than the job posting questions (same themes, different emphasis)
   - **Completely absent** -- some jobs list "questions" in the description as cover-letter instructions, not separate form fields
   - **Extra questions** not shown on the job posting at all

2. **Connects cost** -- Shown clearly at the top ("This proposal requires N Connects")

3. **Available connects** -- Check if there are enough ("Insufficient Connects" warning means can't submit)

4. **Payment structure** -- Fixed-price jobs show milestone fields; hourly jobs show rate field

5. **Form fields present** -- Note which of these exist: Cover Letter, screening question textboxes, milestone fields, rate field, duration dropdown

Update the contract.yaml with:
- `connects_cost`: exact number from the form
- `proposal_form_questions`: the ACTUAL questions from the proposal form (replace the `questions` field if they differ)
- `form_type`: "hourly" or "fixed_milestone" or "fixed_project"
- `has_screening_questions`: true/false (whether separate question textboxes exist on the form)
- `connects_available_at_scout`: number shown, so the orchestrator knows if connects need to be purchased

**Why this matters:** If the proposer writes answers to the wrong questions, the proposal will look off-topic. Always capture the real form questions.

### Client Quality Filtering

**ALWAYS skip** contracts where:
- Client payment is **NOT verified** (this is non-negotiable)
- Client rating is below **4.0** (if they have reviews)
- Budget is below **$20/hr** (hourly) or below **$100** (fixed price)
- There are already **50+ proposals** submitted

**Prefer** contracts where:
- Client has **$1K+ total spent** on Upwork
- Client **hire rate is above 50%**
- Contract is **Intermediate or Expert** level (better rates)
- Posted within the **last 48 hours** (less competition)

### Deduplication

Already handled in Phase 0. Your skip set from startup covers this. As a final safety check before writing, Glob for `data/contracts/*<last-8-of-job-id>*/contract.yaml` and skip if found.

### Cleanup
When done, close the browser instance.

## Upwork-Specific Navigation Tips

- Upwork may show a login wall. The Chrome profile should be pre-authenticated, but if you hit a login screen, **always use "Log in with Google"** -- the Google account is already signed in via the Chrome profile. Click the Google login button, select the account if prompted, and wait for the redirect back to Upwork. Do NOT attempt to type email/password manually.
- Job cards on search results show: title, budget, skills, client country, proposals count, posting age
- Job detail pages have: description, client sidebar (rating, history, location), "About the client" section
- The connects cost is sometimes only visible on the "Submit a Proposal" page -- if you can't find it on the job page, note `connects_cost: null`
- Job URLs follow: `https://www.upwork.com/jobs/<title-slug>~<job-id>/` or `https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~<job-id>/`

## Analytics — Linking Session Replays

Before closing your browser instance, extract the PostHog session ID and fire the completion event directly:

```
mcp__playwright-mux-parallel__browser_evaluate({
  instanceId: "<your-instance-id>",
  expression: "typeof posthog !== 'undefined' && posthog.get_session_id ? posthog.get_session_id() : null"
})
```

Then fire the tracking event (replace `<N>` with contracts saved, `<PH_SESSION_ID>` with the value above):

```bash
python scripts/ph-track upwork_scout_complete contracts_found=<N> agent_model=haiku ph_browser_session_id=<PH_SESSION_ID>
```

## Output

Keep your final response **short** -- the orchestrator has limited context.

**On success:** `SUCCESS: Found N contracts (N saved, N duplicates skipped, N filtered out).`

**On error/partial:** `PARTIAL: Saved N contracts before running out of budget. Listings index at /tmp/upwork_listings.json has M more candidates.`

Do NOT list individual contracts or detailed breakdowns. The orchestrator will read the contract files directly.
